Champion made all my troubles go away. I am very well satisfied with the ending of this series, and although I still have lots of questions for what will happen in June's future I can fill those gaps with my own imagination. Marie Lu did a wonderful job with this entire series, and ended it in a bittersweet note. Without giving out too many spoilers, or none at all, Champion will make your eyes water but it will also lift your spirits.

I am so happy the way that things ended up, yet sad at the same time.I think Marie Lu managed to create her own ending that doesn't compare to the rest.The book's pace was good, the problems it wanted to resolve were plenty and engrossing, and the characters stayed true to form.It was the best ending for this tragic world and marvelous series.
